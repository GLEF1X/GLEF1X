### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm a 18 y.o. full-stack developer from Ukraine who developed an open-source SDK for payment APIs that garnered 80 stars on GitHub and over 110k downloads on PyPi, known as [glQiwiApi](https://github.com/GLEF1X).**

**Currently, I'm dedicating a high percentage of my time to learning frontend development (mainly in React <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg" width="13px" height="13px"/>) and backend development using FastAPI and Django.**

**You can find more information on [my website](https://glefix.dev), which I am currently working on.**
