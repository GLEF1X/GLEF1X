### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**I'm currently dedicating a high percentage of my time to learning frontend development (mainly in React <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg" width="13px" height="13px"/>) and backend development using FastAPI and Django.**

**I created [**Qiwi and YooMoney API wrapper aka glQiwiApi**](https://github.com/GLEF1X/glQiwiApi), [**apscheduler-di**](https://github.com/GLEF1X/apscheduler-di) and a bunch of other open source tools. ðŸš€**

**You can find more information on [my website](https://glefix.dev), which I am currently working on.**
